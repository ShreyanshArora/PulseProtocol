# PulseProtocol

PulseProtocol is a SwiftUI-based, haptic-first Morse code game that lets players decode messages using **touch instead of sight**.

Rather than relying on visuals, PulseProtocol communicates information through short and long vibration patterns, encouraging players to understand rhythm, timing, and memory using haptics alone.

## 🎮 Experience

- Players feel a Morse code pattern through haptics  
- Recreate the pattern using short (`•`) and long (`—`) inputs  
- Successful rounds unlock **progressively more complex levels**

As the game advances:
- Morse sequences become longer  
- Patterns demand higher timing accuracy  
- Cognitive load increases through memory-based gameplay  

---

## ♿ Accessibility

PulseProtocol is designed with **non-visual interaction** in mind.

- Fully playable with eyes closed  
- Supports visually impaired users through haptic-only feedback  
- Demonstrates how touch can replace visual cues in interactive design  

This project explores inclusive design by making haptics the **primary communication channel**, not a secondary effect.

## 🎯 Design Focus

PulseProtocol is intentionally minimal.

- No reliance on graphics or sound  
- Clear game states driven by SwiftUI state management  
- Emphasis on native iOS interaction patterns  

The project highlights how **SwiftUI + haptics** can create meaningful, accessible experiences without visual complexity.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- SwiftUI  
- MVVM Architecture  
- Native iOS Haptics (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`)  
- Swift Concurrency for timed gameplay flow

## 💡 Why PulseProtocol

PulseProtocol challenges the assumption that games must be visual.

It explores how touch can act as a language — making learning interactive, inclusive, and uniquely suited to Apple platforms.
